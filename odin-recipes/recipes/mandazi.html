            <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
                <p>Mandazi is a nice way to introduce you to the joys of East African street food, a spicy, airy yeast doughnut dough made with coconut milk, flavored with cardamom and grated fresh coconut or coconut flakes. It can be made with yeast or baking powder.</p>
                <p>One of the things that excites me about these Mandazi is the concept of adding freshly grated coconut, cardamom and nutmeg spice into the dough. A concept alien to me but one I have come to love.</p>

            <h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
                    <li>2 1/2 tsp. baking powder</li>
                    <li>1/16 cup sugar</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp. salt</li>
                    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour (plus more)</li>
                    <li>3 Tbsp. grated coconut (or coconut flakes)</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp. spices (crushed cardamom)</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp. grated nutmeg (or cinnamon)</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup evaporated milk (/coconut milk)</li>
                    <li>1 large eggs</li>
                    <li>3 Tbsp. melted butter</li>
                    <li>powdered sugar (or cinnamon sugar to sprinkle)</li>
                    <li>caramel sauce (â–ª )</li>
                    <li>vegetable oil (for deep-frying)</li>
                </ul>
            

            <h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large bowl combine all the dry ingredients, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, sugar, cardamom spice and nutmeg. Whisk together.</li>
                    <li>Gently add all the liquid ingredients, eggs, butter and milk. Combine until mixture comes together and dough is smooth. If it is too sticky add a little bit of flour. If too hard add a little bit of water. Dough should not be too sticky, when touched, err on the side of less flour than more flour.</li>
                    <li>Roll out dough in to 1 inch thick. Cut in bite size pieces or triangles like in the picture.</li>
                    <li>In a large sauce pan pour vegetable oil, until it is at least 3 inches (or about 5 centimeters) high (too little will result in flatter mandazi and place on medium heat until oil is 350 degrees.</li>
                    <li>Fry until golden brown about 3-5 minutes depending on size. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper napkin. Serve warm.</li>
